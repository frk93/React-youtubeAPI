## React-youtubeAPI : A sample youtube like project

Make sure to add your Youtube API key
You can create a project on console.developers.google.com and then enable the youtube v3 API. 

This is the sample project to demonstrate the basics of React with API call. It show how to fetch the data and communicate through the components from parent to child and child to parent. 

It will also render a slight look of youtube as well. Go give it a try. 

I used the [materializecss](https://materializecss.com/) for the project. Its still in the early development stages.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### `npm start`
